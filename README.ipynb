His data and source code can be found [here](https://github.com/jldbc/coffee-quality-database). As this dataset was created in 2018, I attempted to use his script to scrape more current data, but it seems the Coffee Institute's webiste is a little different now than it was in 2018. I didn't have too much time to spend adjusting the script as a good chunk was hard-coded, so I've just used his provided data as is."
